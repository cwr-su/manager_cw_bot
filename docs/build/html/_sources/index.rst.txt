Welcome to Manager CW Bot's documentation!
==========================================

The Manager CW Bot API.

.. important::
   This library will help any Telegram Business user to manage their account + start earning thanks to AI and
   additional bot functionality. Therefore, always update the bot and follow the news in the channel:
   `Alexander Twitt <https://t.me/aleksandr_twitt_channel>`_.

   âœ¨ View the latest library updates (`here <./info_updates.html>`_)!

   Use this API for your bot. But before using it,
   read the section "Installation lib, configuration and run the bot".

.. attention::
   Install lib:
   ``pip install manager_cw_bot_api``

   The library is intended for those who have access to YOOKASSA (RU). Since this is required for the
   correct operation of the bot itself, namely the subscription payment system (payment of which will
   be credited to your Telegram (stars) and / or YOOKASSA account)!

.. important::
   By using the CW services (including the CW Bot Manager [API]), you accept the CW User Agreement located on the Internet at (`here <https://acdn.cwr.su/src/acdn/new_user_agreement_manager_cw_bot.pdf>`_).
